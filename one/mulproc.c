/*
 This program will fork two child processes running the two programs generated in programming zero in parallel.
 Hint: You mant need to use fork(), exec() family, wait(), exit(), getpid() and etc   ...
 
 Requirements:
 

 1) Exactly two child processes are created, one to run testspecial program and the other is to run testalphabet program;
 2) When a program starts to run, print a message to the output screen showing which process (with PID) is running which program, for example:
    "CHILD <16741> process is executing testalphabet program!"
    
 3) When a program is done, the process exits and at the same time, a message should be print to the output screen showing which  process (with PID) is done with the program, for example:
    "CHILD <16741> process has done with testalphabet program !"
    
 4) The messages should match the real execution orders, i.e. when the testspecial program starts/ends, the right message should be print out. So you need to figure out how to get the starting/ending time of each 
 process.
   
   
 The expected screen print out should be similar as follows:
 
 CHILD <16741> process is executing testalphabet program!
 CHILD <16742> process is executing testspecial program!
, -> 745668
. -> 798072
... ...

CHILD <16742> process has done with testspecial program !
a -> 2973036
b -> 556908
... ...

CHILD <16741> process has done with testalphabet program !
